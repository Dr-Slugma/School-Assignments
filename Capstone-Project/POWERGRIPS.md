## Capstone Project ##

During my second-to-last semester of classes at UVic, I participated in a capstone project featuring cross-disciplinary Biomedical, Electrical, and Software engineering work.

The video showing the final prototype as well as covering the basics can be found at <https://youtu.be/hSBkPvvHydw>.  The video itself serves as a good introduction to the scope of the project and what was ultimately accomplished, but to briefly summarize: the goal of the project was to build a rigid prosthetic gauntlet capable of self-contained motion capture via potentiometer readings with the goal that technology like this could be used as an analog-digital bridge for sign language users in a wide variety of environments.  To demonstrate some of the potential uses of this technology, a simple Unity program rendering motion in real-time and a simple machine learning program which could recognize basic hand positions were created.
