## Motion Estimation ##

The pupose of this project was to create a Motion Estimation program that would take two image files as input and calculate the motion estimation vectors for each block of the image using the sum of absolute differences.  The goal of the program was to reduce runtime as much as possible using a variety of techniques while still 

### What I Did ###

The project work was about evenly split between myself and my partner for the project, and the both of us touched on most aspects of the project.  We generated the test images, worked out the theory, implemented the algorithm and other necessary methods, then implemented a variety of techniques such as software pipelining, memory management, and register management to try to reduce the runtime of the algorithm as much as possible.
